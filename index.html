          The Jagannath Temple is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Jagannath, a form of Vishnu–one of the trinity
          of
          supreme divinity in Hinduism. It is located in Puri in the state of Odisha, situated on the eastern coast of
          India. As per temple records, the mythical King Indradyumna of Avanti built the main temple of Jagannath at
          Puri.[2] The present temple was rebuilt from the tenth century onwards, on the site of the pre-existing
          temples
          in the compound, but not the main Jagannath temple, and begun by Anantavarman Chodaganga, the first king of
          the
          Eastern Ganga dynasty.[3] Many of the temple rituals are based on Oddiyana Tantras which are the refined
          versions of Mahayana Tantras as well as Shabari Tantras which are evolved from Tantric Buddhism and tribal
          believes respectively. The local legends link the idols with aborginal tribes and the daitapatis (servitors)
          claim to be descendants of the aboriginals.[4] The temple is one of the 108 Abhimana Kshethram of the
          Vaishnavite tradition.The temple is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three
          principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated raths, or temple cars. The worship is performed
          by the Bhil Sabar tribal priests, as well as priests of other communities in the temple.[5] Unlike the stone
          and
          metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood, and is ceremoniously replaced
          every 12 or 19 years by an exact replica.[6]</div>

            <h6>The temple was rebuilt by the King of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, Anantavarman Chodaganga, in the 10th
              century CE, as described by the Kendupatna copper-plate inscription of his descendant, Narasimhadeva
              II.[1] Anantavarman was originally a Shaivite, and became a Vaishnavite sometime after he conquered the
              Utkala region, in which the temple is located, in 1112 CE. A 1134–1135 CE inscription records his donation
              to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.[12]
              Drawing of Jagannath temple from the book L'Inde des rajahs : voyage dans l'Inde centrale et dans les
              présidences de Bombay et de Bengale, 1877 According to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by
              Anangabhimadeva II. Different chronicles
              variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.[13] This suggests that the
              temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's
              son, Anangabhima.[14] The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings,
              including those of the Ganga dynasty and the Gajapati dynasty.[15]</h6>

        <div>The history of the Jagannath Temple can be traced back over a thousand years, with the first mentions of
          the temple dating to the 12th century. It is believed to have been built during the reign of King Anantavarman
          Chodaganga Deva, of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, in the 12th century. The temple’s construction marked the
          beginning of a new era in the religious and cultural landscape of the region.

          The temple’s unique feature is its association with Lord Jagannath, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Jagannath
          is known for his unconventional and mystifying form, with large, wooden idols representing him. The principal
          idols of Lord Jagannath, along with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra, are made from neem wood and
          are renewed every twelve to nineteen years. This practice is an integral part of the temple’s traditions.

        The Jagannath Temple is renowned for its rich and elaborate rituals and festivals. Among the most famous is the
        Rath Yatra, or the Chariot Festival, which attracts millions of pilgrims from all over the world. The Rath Yatra
        involves the ceremonial procession of the deities on grand chariots through the streets of Puri. The chariots
        are massive and ornate, with Lord Jagannath’s chariot, known as Nandighosa, towering at an impressive 45.6 feet.
        The other two chariots are for Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra.
        The Rath Yatra is not only a spectacle but also a deeply spiritual event. It is believed that taking part in
        this procession or even witnessing it grants spiritual merit and cleanses the soul. The pulling of the chariots
        is a collective endeavor, with devotees coming together to participate in this sacred act.
        Another significant festival is the Snana Yatra, where the deities are bathed in public view. This event marks
        the beginning of a fortnight-long period when the idols are secluded from public view for their annual ritual
        bath. The idols are dressed in new outfits every day, and their appearances change throughout this period,
        highlighting the dynamic and unique nature of the worship at the Jagannath Temple.
